The previous AI engineer initiated the Cajá website development, first with a React, FastAPI, and MongoDB stack, then pivoting to a simplified HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP architecture. This involved extensive content and design adaptations to Portuguese and specific brand guidelines. Key features implemented include a functional contact form with user-friendly messages and a demonstration mode, full mobile responsiveness, and later, an integrated MySQL database with an administrative panel for contact management. Automated deployment scripts via SSH were also developed. Most recently, a WhatsApp direct contact feature with multiple strategic buttons was added and restyled for improved aesthetics. The current task revolves around diagnosing why the primary preview URL is failing to load after these recent updates, a recurring theme of environment stability.

<product_requirements>
Cajá Tecnologia Artesanal required a conversion-optimized MVP website in Brazilian Portuguese. Initial needs included detailed service descriptions (MVPs, custom software, digital product management, training), essential pages, and a functional contact form emailing . Design evolved from a lime-yellow palette to Relume.io, then to an official style (Gold/Bronze colors, Gilda Display/Nunito Sans typography), prioritizing a clean, minimal, professional aesthetic. Content and layout underwent iterative refinements, including section removals and text updates. A major architectural shift to HTML/CSS/JS/PHP was mandated for Hostinger compatibility, ensuring functionality and design were maintained. Subsequent requests involved perfect mobile responsiveness, user-friendly contact form messages, a MySQL database for contact storage with an admin panel, and an engaging WhatsApp direct contact feature for increased conversions.

Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation and initial styling of the WhatsApp direct contact feature. This involved adding a floating Vamos conversar? button and integrated buttons in the Sobre section and near the contact form, all directing to the specified WhatsApp Business number with pre-filled messages. After the user reported the initial WhatsApp buttons appearing feio, pequeno e sem formatação, the AI undertook significant styling enhancements in  and  to make them larger, visually appealing with gradients and animations, and responsive.

Upon attempting to show the updated WhatsApp buttons in the main preview environment, the user reported, não aparece nada aqui: https://662324c2-3482-4a07-9bb0-b609420ddac0.preview.emergentagent.com/. This indicates a critical issue with the preview environment itself, possibly a server misconfiguration or service interruption that causes the site to not load at all, despite previous fixes for the preview environment. The AI has just acknowledged this report and is about to begin diagnosing the cause of the blank preview page.

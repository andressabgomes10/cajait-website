The previous AI engineer initiated the development of the Cajá website, starting with a React, FastAPI, and MongoDB full-stack application, adhering to specific design principles and a  playbook initially. The user provided iterative feedback, leading to multiple design overhauls, content adjustments, and layout refinements, including adopting a comprehensive Relume style guide and translating all content to Portuguese. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested simplifying the entire stack to plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, eliminating Node.js, Python, and MongoDB. The engineer successfully transitioned the codebase, implementing the contact form in PHP. Subsequent interactions involved debugging the simplified environment (e.g., PHP installation issues) and refining mobile responsiveness, culminating in the current task of making error messages more user-friendly. The engineer consistently adapted to complex, iterative, and sometimes contradictory (e.g., design changes, full-stack pivot) user requirements, demonstrating strong adaptability and technical execution.

<product_requirements>
The user, representing Cajá Tecnologia Artesanal, required a conversion-optimized MVP website. Initial requirements included detailed service descriptions (MVPs, custom software, digital product management, training) without formal case studies, essential pages only (no blog), integration with LinkedIn and Instagram, and a functional contact form sending emails to  (Hostinger). Design mandates evolved from an initial bright lime-yellow palette to a Relume.io style guide, then to a refined official style with Gold (#F6D100) and Bronze (#3E2F08) colors, Gilda Display/Nunito Sans typography, and a clean, minimal, professional aesthetic. All content was explicitly requested in Brazilian Portuguese. Iterative layout adjustments included removing specific sections (visualização do projeto, nosso processo, outras formas de contato), refining the hero section text to Cajá. Tecnologia Artesanal. with a detailed subtitle, removing social media text/icons from the contact section, and updating/removing specific statistics in the Sobre section. A major shift was to convert the entire application from React/FastAPI/MongoDB to a simplified HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP stack, suitable for direct Hostinger upload, while maintaining functionality and design. Finally, ensuring full mobile responsiveness and user-friendly error messages were requested.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Technologies:** React (initial), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (final), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, BrowserRouter (React).
- **Backend Technologies:** FastAPI, MongoDB (initial), PHP (final, for email).
- **Styling/Design:** Relume.io style guide, specific color palettes (lime, then Gold/Bronze), typography (Crimson Text/Inter, then Gilda Display/Nunito Sans), glass-morphism effects, responsive design.
- **Development Workflow:** Mock data for frontend first, then backend integration, environment variable management, supervisor for service control.
- **Email Integration:** SMTP (initial backend), PHP  function (final simplified backend) for Hostinger.

<code_architecture>
The application underwent a significant architectural shift from a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack to a simplified HTML/CSS/JS/PHP structure.

**Initial Architecture (React/FastAPI/MongoDB):**
This was a full-stack application.
*   **Frontend (React):** Served on port 3000, using  with . Utilized  for API calls. Relied on  from . Integrated Shadcn UI components (e.g., Accordion, Button, Dialog) and Radix UI primitives. Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Backend (FastAPI):** Ran internally on . Used ,  (for MongoDB), . Defined API routes prefixed with . MongoDB connection via  from . Includes models for  and contact forms (later added).
*   **Database (MongoDB):** Accessed via  environment variable.

**Final Architecture (HTML/CSS/JS/PHP):**
The entire previous stack was removed and replaced with a flat file structure designed for simple hosting.

-   ****: The main entry point for the website, containing the full structure of the landing page (Hero, Services, About, Contact). This file was dynamically generated to match the previous React app's visual structure.
    -   *Importance:* The core content and structure of the entire website.
    -   *Changes:* Replaced the React application's root with a static HTML file, integrating content and elements from the previous React components. Updated numerous times for content, layout, and responsiveness.
-   ****: Contains all the styling rules for the website, originally derived from Tailwind CSS and Radix UI theme, then refined to match the Relume and official Cajá design guidelines (colors, typography, spacing, animations). Crucial for responsiveness.
    -   *Importance:* Defines the visual appearance and layout of the entire website, including responsive adjustments.
    -   *Changes:* Extensively modified throughout the process to implement different design guidelines (lime -> Relume -> official Cajá), translate text, adjust spacing, remove/add sections, and, most recently, fix mobile responsiveness using  and media queries.
-   ****: Handles client-side interactivity, primarily for navigation (smooth scrolling) and the contact form submission.
    -   *Importance:* Provides interactive elements and smooth user experience.
    -   *Changes:* Modified to handle form submissions via AJAX to  and manage basic UI feedback.
-   ****: The backend script for processing the contact form submissions.
    -   *Importance:* Enables the core functionality of sending contact messages to .
    -   *Changes:* Initially designed for SMTP, then simplified to use PHP's native  function for Hostinger compatibility, added CORS headers, basic logging, and error handling.
-   ****: Provides clear, step-by-step instructions for deploying the simplified website to Hostinger.
    -   *Importance:* Guides the user through the deployment process.
    -   *Changes:* Created to document the upload and permission setup for Hostinger.

<pending_tasks>
- Make the form submission feedback more user-friendly. The user reported: agora apareceu isso. e eu quero que apareça algo mais amigável (now this appeared, and I want something more friendly). This implies an unfriendly error/success message being displayed after form submission.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a bug report regarding mobile responsiveness. The user reported that the initial page was desconfigurada (misconfigured/disorganized) on mobile devices and requested that all elements have good responsiveness.

The AI engineer successfully implemented corrections to  to ensure perfect mobile responsiveness. This involved:
- Optimizing font sizes using  for different screen sizes.
- Reducing spacing specifically for mobile layouts.
- Adjusting button widths and centralization for mobile.
- Adding lateral padding to text to improve readability on smaller screens.
- Resizing decorative elements and icons.
- Implementing detailed breakpoints for various mobile and tablet sizes (1024px+, 768px, 480px, landscape).

After these extensive mobile responsiveness fixes, the AI engineer confirmed the website was perfectly responsive across multiple device simulations (iPhone SE, iPhone 12, iPhone 11 Pro Max, Android small, Landscape). The user was instructed to upload the updated  and clear their browser cache.

The very next message from the user, which is the current state, reports a new issue: agora apareceu isso. e eu quero que apareça algo mais amigável (now this appeared, and I want something more friendly). This indicates that while the mobile layout is fixed, the form submission (from ) is now displaying an unfriendly message, likely a raw server error or a default PHP message, instead of a user-friendly success or error notification.

Address the unfriendly form submission message by implementing a more user-friendly feedback mechanism.
